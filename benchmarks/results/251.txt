Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 1)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 1)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k >= 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k <= 1)
Addind predicate k <= 1 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['k <= 1']
Verifying formula: ( <= k 1 )
For candidate: assert((k <= 1))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(i >= 1);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(i >= 1);
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
