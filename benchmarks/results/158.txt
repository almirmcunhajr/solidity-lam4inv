Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(a == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 1)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m > 0)
Addind predicate m > 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['m > 0']
Verifying formula: ( > m 0 )
For candidate: assert((m > 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(m > 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(m > 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(-m <= a && a <= m);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(-m <= a && a <= m);
Verifying candidate: assert(-(j - 1) <= a && a <= (j - 1));
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(-(j - 1) <= a && a <= (j - 1));
Verifying candidate: assert(1 <= j && j <= m + 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(1 <= j && j <= m + 1);
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m > 0);
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(-m <= a && a <= m);
Addind predicate -m <= a to verify set
Addind predicate a <= m to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(-(j - 1) <= a && a <= (j - 1));
Addind predicate -(j - 1) <= a to verify set
Addind predicate a <= (j - 1) to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(1 <= j && j <= m + 1);
Addind predicate 1 <= j to verify set
Addind predicate j <= m + 1 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['m > 0', '-m <= a', 'a <= m', '-(j - 1) <= a', 'a <= (j - 1)', '1 <= j', 'j <= m + 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( > m 0 ) ( <= ( - 0 m ) a ) ) ( <= a m ) ) ( <= ( - 0 ( - j 1 ) ) a ) ) ( <= a ( - j 1 ) ) ) ( <= 1 j ) ) ( <= j ( + m 1 ) ) )
For candidate: assert((m > 0) && (-m <= a) && (a <= m) && (-(j - 1) <= a) && (a <= (j - 1)) && (1 <= j) && (j <= m + 1))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((m > 0) && (-m <= a) && (a <= m) && (-(j - 1) <= a) && (a <= (j - 1)) && (1 <= j) && (j <= m + 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((m > 0) && (-m <= a) && (a <= m) && (-(j - 1) <= a) && (a <= (j - 1)) && (1 <= j) && (j <= m + 1))
