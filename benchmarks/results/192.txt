Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i < n)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= i && i <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= i && i <= n);
Verifying candidate: assert((b == 0 && i == 0) || (b != 0));
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert((b == 0 && i == 0) || (b != 0));
Verifying candidate: assert((i < n) || (b != 0));
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert((i < n) || (b != 0));
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(0 <= i && i <= n);
Addind predicate 0 <= i to verify set
Addind predicate i <= n to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert((b == 0 && i == 0) || (b != 0));
Addind predicate ((b == 0 && i == 0)) || ((b != 0)) to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert((i < n) || (b != 0));
Addind predicate ((i < n)) || ((b != 0)) to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['0 <= i', 'i <= n', '((b == 0 && i == 0)) || ((b != 0))', '((i < n)) || ((b != 0))']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( <= 0 i ) ( <= i n ) ) ( or ( and ( = b 0 ) ( = i 0 ) ) ( distinct b 0 ) ) ) ( or ( < i n ) ( distinct b 0 ) ) )
For candidate: assert((0 <= i) && (i <= n) && (((b == 0 && i == 0)) || ((b != 0))) && (((i < n)) || ((b != 0))))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((0 <= i) && (i <= n) && (((b == 0 && i == 0)) || ((b != 0))) && (((i < n)) || ((b != 0))))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((0 <= i) && (i <= n) && (((b == 0 && i == 0)) || ((b != 0))) && (((i < n)) || ((b != 0))))
