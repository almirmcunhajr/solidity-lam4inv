Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert((x + y) == k)
Addind predicate (x + y) == k to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['(x + y) == k']
Verifying formula: ( = ( + x y ) k )
For candidate: assert(((x + y) == k))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert(((x + y) == k))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert(((x + y) == k))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 9.421878814697266 seconds
