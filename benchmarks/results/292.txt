Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i < j)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k > 0)
Addind predicate k > 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['k > 0']
Verifying formula: ( > k 0 )
For candidate: assert((k > 0))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((k > 0))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((k > 0))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 1.499040126800537 seconds
