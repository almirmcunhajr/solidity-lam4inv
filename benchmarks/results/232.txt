Addind predicate x >= 2 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= y);
Addind predicate x <= y to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x < y);
Predicate filtering verify set: ['y > 2', 'x >= 2', 'x <= y']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( > y 2 ) ( >= x 2 ) ) ( <= x y ) )
For candidate: assert((y > 2) && (x >= 2) && (x <= y))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((y > 2) && (x >= 2) && (x <= y))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((y > 2) && (x >= 2) && (x <= y))
