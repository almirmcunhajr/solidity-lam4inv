Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n == 1 || n == 2)
Addind predicate (n == 1) || (n == 2) to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['(n == 1) || (n == 2)']
Verifying formula: ( or ( = n 1 ) ( = n 2 ) )
For candidate: assert(((n == 1) || (n == 2)))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(n == 1 || n == 2);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(n == 1 || n == 2);
Verifying candidate: assert(i >= 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i >= 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(j == i * n);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(j == i * n);
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
