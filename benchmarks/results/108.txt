Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Addind predicate j == 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(a <= m)
Addind predicate a <= m to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['j == 0', 'a <= m']
Verifying formula: ( and ( = j 0 ) ( <= a m ) )
For candidate: assert((j == 0) && (a <= m))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((j == 0) && (a <= m))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((j == 0) && (a <= m))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 2.0490050315856934 seconds
