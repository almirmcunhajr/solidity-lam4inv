Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k == x + y)
Addind predicate k == x + y to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['k == x + y']
Verifying formula: ( = k ( + x y ) )
For candidate: assert((k == x + y))

Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x + y == k);
Addind predicate x + y == k to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m >= 0);
Addind predicate m >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m == 0 || m < j);
Addind predicate (m == 0) || (m < j) to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(0 <= j);
Addind predicate 0 <= j to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j < n);
Predicate filtering verify set: ['k == x + y', 'x + y == k', 'm >= 0', '(m == 0) || (m < j)', '0 <= j']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( = k ( + x y ) ) ( = ( + x y ) k ) ) ( >= m 0 ) ) ( or ( = m 0 ) ( < m j ) ) ) ( <= 0 j ) )
For candidate: assert((k == x + y) && (x + y == k) && (m >= 0) && ((m == 0) || (m < j)) && (0 <= j))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((k == x + y) && (x + y == k) && (m >= 0) && ((m == 0) || (m < j)) && (0 <= j))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((k == x + y) && (x + y == k) && (m >= 0) && ((m == 0) || (m < j)) && (0 <= j))
