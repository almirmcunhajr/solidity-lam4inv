Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Addind predicate j == 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n <= 50000001)
Addind predicate n <= 50000001 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['j == 0', 'n <= 50000001']
Verifying formula: ( and ( = j 0 ) ( <= n 50000001 ) )
For candidate: assert((j == 0) && (n <= 50000001))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(n <= 50000001);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(n <= 50000001);
Verifying candidate: assert(i >= 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i >= 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(i % 3 == 0);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(i % 3 == 0);
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
