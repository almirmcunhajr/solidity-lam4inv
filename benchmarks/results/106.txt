Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(a <= m)
Addind predicate a <= m to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j < 1)
Addind predicate j < 1 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['a <= m', 'j < 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( <= a m ) ( < j 1 ) )
For candidate: assert((a <= m) && (j < 1))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((a <= m) && (j < 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((a <= m) && (j < 1))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 2.0326318740844727 seconds
