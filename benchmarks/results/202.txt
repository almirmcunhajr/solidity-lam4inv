Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= 1)
Addind predicate x <= 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x <= 1']
Verifying formula: ( <= x 1 )
For candidate: assert((x <= 1))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 2 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x <= 1);
Verifying candidate: assert(y >= -3);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(y >= -3);
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
