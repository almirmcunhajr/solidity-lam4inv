Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y > 0 || x > 0)
Addind predicate (y > 0) || (x > 0) to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['(y > 0) || (x > 0)']
Verifying formula: ( or ( > y 0 ) ( > x 0 ) )
For candidate: assert(((y > 0) || (x > 0)))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert(((y > 0) || (x > 0)))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert(((y > 0) || (x > 0)))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 1.422590970993042 seconds
