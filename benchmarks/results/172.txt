Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(sum == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n > 0)
Addind predicate n > 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n > 0']
Verifying formula: ( > n 0 )
For candidate: assert((n > 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 9 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(n > 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(n > 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(i >= 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i >= 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(i <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i <= n);
Verifying candidate: assert(2*sum == i*(i - 1));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(2*sum == i*(i - 1));
