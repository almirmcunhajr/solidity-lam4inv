Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Addind predicate j == 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(turn == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['j == 0']
Verifying formula: ( = j 0 )
For candidate: assert((j == 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 5 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x == y);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x == y);
Verifying candidate: assert(i >= j);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(i >= j);
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
