Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x < 100)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y < 100)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= 100);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x <= 100);
Verifying candidate: assert(y <= 100);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(y <= 100);
Verifying candidate: assert(((x < 100) && (y < 100) && (x + 1 <= 100) && (y + 1 <= 100)) || (!((x < 100) && (y < 100))));
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(((x < 100) && (y < 100) && (x + 1 <= 100) && (y + 1 <= 100)) || (!((x < 100) && (y < 100))));
Verifying candidate: assert((((x >= 100) || (y >= 100)) && ((x == 100) || (y == 100))) || (!((x >= 100) || (y >= 100))));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((((x >= 100) || (y >= 100)) && ((x == 100) || (y == 100))) || (!((x >= 100) || (y >= 100))));
