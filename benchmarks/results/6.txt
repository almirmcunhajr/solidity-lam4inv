Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= x);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= x);
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= size);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x <= size);
Verifying candidate: assert((x == 0) || (y <= z));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((x == 0) || (y <= z));
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
