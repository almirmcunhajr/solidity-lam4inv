Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i >= 1)
Addind predicate i >= 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j >= 1)
Addind predicate j >= 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i * i < j * j)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['i >= 1', 'j >= 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( >= i 1 ) ( >= j 1 ) )
For candidate: assert((i >= 1) && (j >= 1))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(i >= 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i >= 1);
Verifying candidate: assert(j >= 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(j >= 1);
Verifying candidate: assert(i <= j);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(i <= j);
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
