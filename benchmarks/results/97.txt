Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 2)
Addind predicate y == 2 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['y == 2']
Verifying formula: ( = y 2 )
For candidate: assert((y == 2))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((y == 2))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((y == 2))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 1.9418389797210693 seconds
