Addind predicate n <= 20000001 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n <= 20000001']
Verifying formula: ( <= n 20000001 )
For candidate: assert((n <= 20000001))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 11 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(n <= 20000001);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(n <= 20000001);
Verifying candidate: assert(l <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(l <= n);
Verifying candidate: assert((i + j + k + v4 + v3 + v2 + v1 + v5) == l);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((i + j + k + v4 + v3 + v2 + v1 + v5) == l);
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
