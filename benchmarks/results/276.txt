Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= i);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= i);
Verifying candidate: assert(i <= 100);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i <= 100);
Verifying candidate: assert(j == 2*i);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(j == 2*i);
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(0 <= i);
Addind predicate 0 <= i to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i <= 100);
Addind predicate i <= 100 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 2*i);
Addind predicate j == 2*i to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['0 <= i', 'i <= 100', 'j == 2*i']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( <= 0 i ) ( <= i 100 ) ) ( = j ( * 2 i ) ) )
For candidate: assert((0 <= i) && (i <= 100) && (j == 2*i))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((0 <= i) && (i <= 100) && (j == 2*i))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((0 <= i) && (i <= 100) && (j == 2*i))
3 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 18.758454084396362 seconds
The total runtime was 19.844841957092285 seconds
