Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(nlen == idBitLength / 32)
Addind predicate nlen == idBitLength / 32 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(idBitLength >= 0)
Addind predicate idBitLength >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(materialLength >= 0)
Addind predicate materialLength >= 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['nlen == idBitLength / 32', 'idBitLength >= 0', 'materialLength >= 0']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( = nlen ( div idBitLength 32 ) ) ( >= idBitLength 0 ) ) ( >= materialLength 0 ) )
For candidate: assert((nlen == idBitLength / 32) && (idBitLength >= 0) && (materialLength >= 0))
