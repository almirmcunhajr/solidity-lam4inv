Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert((x == 1 && y == 0) || (x > 1 && y == n - (x - 1)));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((x == 1 && y == 0) || (x > 1 && y == n - (x - 1)));
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
