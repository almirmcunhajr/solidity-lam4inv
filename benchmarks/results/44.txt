Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c == 0)
Addind predicate c == 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n > 0)
Addind predicate n > 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['c == 0', 'n > 0']
Verifying formula: ( and ( = c 0 ) ( > n 0 ) )
For candidate: assert((c == 0) && (n > 0))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((c == 0) && (n > 0))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((c == 0) && (n > 0))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 3.0789270401000977 seconds
