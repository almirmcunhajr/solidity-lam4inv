Predicate filtering verify set: ['size >= 1', 'i >= 1', 'i <= size + 1', '0 <= sn', 'sn <= size', 'sn == i - 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( >= size 1 ) ( >= i 1 ) ) ( <= i ( + size 1 ) ) ) ( <= 0 sn ) ) ( <= sn size ) ) ( = sn ( - i 1 ) ) )
For candidate: assert((size >= 1) && (i >= 1) && (i <= size + 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= size) && (sn == i - 1))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((size >= 1) && (i >= 1) && (i <= size + 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= size) && (sn == i - 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((size >= 1) && (i >= 1) && (i <= size + 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= size) && (sn == i - 1))
