Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y > -1000)
Addind predicate y > -1000 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y < 1000)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['y > -1000']
Verifying formula: ( > y ( - 0 1000 ) )
For candidate: assert((y > -1000))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 2 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(y > -1000);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(y > -1000);
Verifying candidate: assert((x >= 0 && y > 0) || (x < 0 && y > -1000));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((x >= 0 && y > 0) || (x < 0 && y > -1000));
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
