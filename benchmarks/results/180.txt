Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n > 0)
Addind predicate n > 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n > 0']
Verifying formula: ( > n 0 )
For candidate: assert((n > 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 6 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= x && x <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= x && x <= n);
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= m);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= m);
Verifying candidate: assert(m <= x);
