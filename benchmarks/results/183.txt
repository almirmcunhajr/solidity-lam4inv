Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Addind predicate i == 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x != y)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(t == y)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['i == 0']
Verifying formula: ( = i 0 )
For candidate: assert((i == 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(i == 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i == 0);
Verifying candidate: assert((x > 0 && y >= t) || (x <= 0 && y == t));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((x > 0 && y >= t) || (x <= 0 && y == t));
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
