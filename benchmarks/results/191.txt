For candidate: assert((a <= 1000000) && (b >= 0) && (b <= 1000000) && (cnt >= 0) && (cnt <= b) && (res == a + (b - cnt)) && (res + cnt == a + b))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((a <= 1000000) && (b >= 0) && (b <= 1000000) && (cnt >= 0) && (cnt <= b) && (res == a + (b - cnt)) && (res + cnt == a + b))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((a <= 1000000) && (b >= 0) && (b <= 1000000) && (cnt >= 0) && (cnt <= b) && (res == a + (b - cnt)) && (res + cnt == a + b))
