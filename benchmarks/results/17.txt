Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(1 <= m && m <= x);
Addind predicate 1 <= m to verify set
Addind predicate m <= x to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m < n);
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= 1);
Addind predicate x >= 1 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['1 <= m', 'm <= x', 'x >= 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( <= 1 m ) ( <= m x ) ) ( >= x 1 ) )
For candidate: assert((1 <= m) && (m <= x) && (x >= 1))

# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-mini model: assert(n <= 1 || m < n);
3 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
