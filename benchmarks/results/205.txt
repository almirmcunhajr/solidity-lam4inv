Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == x)
Addind predicate y == x to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['y == x']
Verifying formula: ( = y x )
For candidate: assert((y == x))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((y == x))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((y == x))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 0.7870619297027588 seconds
