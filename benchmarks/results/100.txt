Predicate filtering verify set: ['n >= 0', 'y == n - x', '0 <= x', 'x <= n', '0 <= y']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( >= n 0 ) ( = y ( - n x ) ) ) ( <= 0 x ) ) ( <= x n ) ) ( <= 0 y ) )
For candidate: assert((n >= 0) && (y == n - x) && (0 <= x) && (x <= n) && (0 <= y))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((n >= 0) && (y == n - x) && (0 <= x) && (x <= n) && (0 <= y))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((n >= 0) && (y == n - x) && (0 <= x) && (x <= n) && (0 <= y))
