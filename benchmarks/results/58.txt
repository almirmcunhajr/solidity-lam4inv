Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n > 0)
Addind predicate n > 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n > 0']
Verifying formula: ( > n 0 )
For candidate: assert((n > 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(n > 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(n > 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= c && c <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= c && c <= n);
Verifying candidate: assert(c == n || c < n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(c == n || c < n);
Verifying candidate: assert(c >= 0);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(c >= 0);
3 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 32.02870202064514 seconds
The total runtime was 35.46644902229309 seconds
