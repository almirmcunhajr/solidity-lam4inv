Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == sn + 1);
Addind predicate i == sn + 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(0 <= sn);
Addind predicate 0 <= sn to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(sn <= size);
Addind predicate sn <= size to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(size >= 1);
Predicate filtering verify set: ['size >= 1', 'i == sn + 1', '0 <= sn', 'sn <= size']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( >= size 1 ) ( = i ( + sn 1 ) ) ) ( <= 0 sn ) ) ( <= sn size ) )
For candidate: assert((size >= 1) && (i == sn + 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= size))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((size >= 1) && (i == sn + 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= size))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((size >= 1) && (i == sn + 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= size))
