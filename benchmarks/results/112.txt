Predicate filtering verify set: ['n >= 1', 'i == sn + 1', 'sn >= 0', 'sn <= n', 'i >= 1', 'i <= n + 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( >= n 1 ) ( = i ( + sn 1 ) ) ) ( >= sn 0 ) ) ( <= sn n ) ) ( >= i 1 ) ) ( <= i ( + n 1 ) ) )

Predicate filtering found solution: assert((n >= 1) && (i == sn + 1) && (sn >= 0) && (sn <= n) && (i >= 1) && (i <= n + 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((n >= 1) && (i == sn + 1) && (sn >= 0) && (sn <= n) && (i >= 1) && (i <= n + 1))
