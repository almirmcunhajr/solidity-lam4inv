Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == i)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == i)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(z == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i >= 0)
Addind predicate i >= 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['i >= 0']
Verifying formula: ( >= i 0 )
For candidate: assert((i >= 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 5 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x == i - z);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x == i - z);
Verifying candidate: assert(y == x - z);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(y == x - z);
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
