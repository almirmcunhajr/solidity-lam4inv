Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k == x + y)
Addind predicate k == x + y to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['k == x + y']
Verifying formula: ( = k ( + x y ) )
For candidate: assert((k == x + y))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x + y == k);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x + y == k);
Verifying candidate: assert(m <= j);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(m <= j);
Verifying candidate: assert(!(n > 0) || (m < n));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(!(n > 0) || (m < n));
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
