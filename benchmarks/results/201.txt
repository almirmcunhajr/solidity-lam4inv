Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= -2)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= -3)
Addind predicate x >= -3 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x >= -3']
Verifying formula: ( >= x ( - 0 3 ) )
For candidate: assert((x >= -3))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x >= -3))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x >= -3))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 2.042362928390503 seconds
