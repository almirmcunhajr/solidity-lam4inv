Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y >= 0)
Addind predicate y >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y <= 127)
Addind predicate y <= 127 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['y >= 0', 'y <= 127']
Verifying formula: ( and ( >= y 0 ) ( <= y 127 ) )
For candidate: assert((y >= 0) && (y <= 127))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((y >= 0) && (y <= 127))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((y >= 0) && (y <= 127))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
