Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 1)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(1 <= x && x <= 11);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(1 <= x && x <= 11);
Verifying candidate: assert((x >= 2 && x <= 11) ? (y == 11 - x) : true);
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-mini and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(1 <= x && x <= 11);
Candidate already in fail history: assert(1 <= x && x <= 11);
Verifying candidate: assert(!(x >= 2) || y == 11 - x);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-mini model: assert(!(x >= 2) || y == 11 - x);
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 1 repeated fails
