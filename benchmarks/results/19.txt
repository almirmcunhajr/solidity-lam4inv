Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= x);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= x);

# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(!(n > 0) || (m < n));
