Predicate filtering found solution: assert(((x + y) == k) && (j >= 0) && (((m == 0)) || ((m > 0 && m <= n))) && (m >= 0) && (m <= j))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert(((x + y) == k) && (j >= 0) && (((m == 0)) || ((m > 0 && m <= n))) && (m >= 0) && (m <= j))
