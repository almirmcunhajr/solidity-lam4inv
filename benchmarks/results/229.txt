Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 1 || x == 2)
Addind predicate (x == 1) || (x == 2) to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['(x == 1) || (x == 2)']
Verifying formula: ( or ( = x 1 ) ( = x 2 ) )
For candidate: assert(((x == 1) || (x == 2)))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert(((x == 1) || (x == 2)))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert(((x == 1) || (x == 2)))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 2.0797858238220215 seconds
