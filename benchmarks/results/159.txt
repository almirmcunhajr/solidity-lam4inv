Predicate filtering verify set: ['n > 0', 'j >= 0', 'j <= n', 'k >= n - j']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( > n 0 ) ( >= j 0 ) ) ( <= j n ) ) ( >= k ( - n j ) ) )
For candidate: assert((n > 0) && (j >= 0) && (j <= n) && (k >= n - j))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((n > 0) && (j >= 0) && (j <= n) && (k >= n - j))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((n > 0) && (j >= 0) && (j <= n) && (k >= n - j))
