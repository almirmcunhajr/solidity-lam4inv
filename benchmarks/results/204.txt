Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= 5)
Addind predicate x <= 5 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= 4)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y <= 5)
Addind predicate y <= 5 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y >= 4)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x <= 5', 'y <= 5']
Verifying formula: ( and ( <= x 5 ) ( <= y 5 ) )
For candidate: assert((x <= 5) && (y <= 5))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 2 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(y <= 5);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(y <= 5);
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
