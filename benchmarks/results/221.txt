Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == w)
Addind predicate x == w to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(z == y)
Addind predicate z == y to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x > 0)
Addind predicate x > 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y > 0)
Addind predicate y > 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(z > 0)
Addind predicate z > 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(w > 0)
Addind predicate w > 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x == w', 'z == y', 'x > 0', 'y > 0', 'z > 0', 'w > 0']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( = x w ) ( = z y ) ) ( > x 0 ) ) ( > y 0 ) ) ( > z 0 ) ) ( > w 0 ) )
For candidate: assert((x == w) && (z == y) && (x > 0) && (y > 0) && (z > 0) && (w > 0))

Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x == w);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x == w);
Verifying candidate: assert(y == z);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(y == z);
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
