Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 1)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 1)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x > 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x > 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(y > 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(y > 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= y);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x <= y);
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x > 0);
Addind predicate x > 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y > 0);
Addind predicate y > 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= y);
Addind predicate x <= y to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x > 0', 'y > 0', 'x <= y']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( > x 0 ) ( > y 0 ) ) ( <= x y ) )
For candidate: assert((x > 0) && (y > 0) && (x <= y))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x > 0) && (y > 0) && (x <= y))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((x > 0) && (y > 0) && (x <= y))
3 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 20.719479084014893 seconds
The total runtime was 22.40623903274536 seconds
