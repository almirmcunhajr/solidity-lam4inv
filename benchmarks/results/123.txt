Predicate filtering verify set: ['size >= 1', 'i == sn + 1', '0 <= sn', 'sn <= size', '1 <= i', 'i <= size + 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( >= size 1 ) ( = i ( + sn 1 ) ) ) ( <= 0 sn ) ) ( <= sn size ) ) ( <= 1 i ) ) ( <= i ( + size 1 ) ) )

Predicate filtering found solution: assert((size >= 1) && (i == sn + 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= size) && (1 <= i) && (i <= size + 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((size >= 1) && (i == sn + 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= size) && (1 <= i) && (i <= size + 1))
