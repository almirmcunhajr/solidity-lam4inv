Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == n)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 2 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x <= n);
Verifying candidate: assert(!(x > 1) || (n > 1));
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(!(x > 1) || (n > 1));
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= n);
Addind predicate x <= n to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(!(x > 1) || (n > 1));
Addind predicate (!(x > 1)) || ((n > 1)) to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x <= n', '(!(x > 1)) || ((n > 1))']
Verifying formula: ( and ( <= x n ) ( or ( not ( > x 1 ) ) ( > n 1 ) ) )
For candidate: assert((x <= n) && ((!(x > 1)) || ((n > 1))))

Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert((x >= 1 && x <= n) || n <= 0);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-mini model: assert((x >= 1 && x <= n) || n <= 0);
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
