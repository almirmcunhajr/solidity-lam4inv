Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n >= 0)
Addind predicate n >= 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n >= 0']
Verifying formula: ( >= n 0 )
For candidate: assert((n >= 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= x);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= x);
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= n);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(x <= n);
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 20.947556257247925 seconds
The total runtime was 22.26701307296753 seconds
