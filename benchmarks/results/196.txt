Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k == x + y)
Addind predicate k == x + y to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['k == x + y']
Verifying formula: ( = k ( + x y ) )
For candidate: assert((k == x + y))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((k == x + y))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((k == x + y))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 5.150361776351929 seconds
