Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(v == 1)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(v >= 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(v >= 1);
Verifying candidate: assert(v <= 51);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(v <= 51);
Verifying candidate: assert(v % 2 == 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(v % 2 == 1);
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(v >= 1);
Addind predicate v >= 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(v <= 51);
Addind predicate v <= 51 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(v % 2 == 1);
Addind predicate v % 2 == 1 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['v >= 1', 'v <= 51', 'v % 2 == 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( >= v 1 ) ( <= v 51 ) ) ( = ( mod v 2 ) 1 ) )
For candidate: assert((v >= 1) && (v <= 51) && (v % 2 == 1))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((v >= 1) && (v <= 51) && (v % 2 == 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((v >= 1) && (v <= 51) && (v % 2 == 1))
3 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
