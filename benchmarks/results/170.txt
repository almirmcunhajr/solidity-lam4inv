Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert((x + y) == k)
Addind predicate (x + y) == k to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['(x + y) == k']
Verifying formula: ( = ( + x y ) k )
For candidate: assert(((x + y) == k))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
