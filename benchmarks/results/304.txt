Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(z == 0)
Addind predicate z == 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['z == 0']
Verifying formula: ( = z 0 )
For candidate: assert((z == 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert((x >= 0) && (x <= 10000000));
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert((x >= 0) && (x <= 10000000));
Verifying candidate: assert((x >= 5000000) || (z == 0));
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert((x >= 5000000) || (z == 0));
Verifying candidate: assert((z % 2) == 0);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((z % 2) == 0);
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 40.0730926990509 seconds
The total runtime was 41.34974002838135 seconds
