Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(p == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c == cl)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(p >= 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(p >= 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(p <= 4);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(p <= 4);
Verifying candidate: assert(cl == c - p);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(cl == c - p);
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(p >= 0);
Addind predicate p >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(p <= 4);
Addind predicate p <= 4 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(cl == c - p);
Addind predicate cl == c - p to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['p >= 0', 'p <= 4', 'cl == c - p']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( >= p 0 ) ( <= p 4 ) ) ( = cl ( - c p ) ) )
For candidate: assert((p >= 0) && (p <= 4) && (cl == c - p))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((p >= 0) && (p <= 4) && (cl == c - p))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((p >= 0) && (p <= 4) && (cl == c - p))
3 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 51.10858511924744 seconds
