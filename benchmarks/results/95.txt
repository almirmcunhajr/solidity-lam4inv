Executing predicate filtering

Addind predicate i >= 0 to verify set

Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 1);
Predicate filtering verify set: ['y == 1', 'i == j', 'i >= 0', 'j >= 0']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( = y 1 ) ( = i j ) ) ( >= i 0 ) ) ( >= j 0 ) )
For candidate: assert((y == 1) && (i == j) && (i >= 0) && (j >= 0))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((y == 1) && (i == j) && (i >= 0) && (j >= 0))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((y == 1) && (i == j) && (i >= 0) && (j >= 0))
