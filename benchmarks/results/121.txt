Predicate filtering found solution: assert((i >= 1) && (sn >= 0) && (i - sn == 1) && (1 <= i) && (i <= 9) && (sn == i - 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-mini model: assert((i >= 1) && (sn >= 0) && (i - sn == 1) && (1 <= i) && (i <= 9) && (sn == i - 1))
