Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x < y)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y <= 20000001)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 2 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x < y);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x < y);
Verifying candidate: assert(((x < 0) && (7 - (-10) >= 4)) || ((x < 0) && (y >= 0) && (7 - 3 >= 4)) || ((x >= 0) && (y < 0) && (10 - (-10) >= 4)) || ((x >= 0) && (y >= 0) && (10 - 3 >= 4)));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(((x < 0) && (7 - (-10) >= 4)) || ((x < 0) && (y >= 0) && (7 - 3 >= 4)) || ((x >= 0) && (y < 0) && (10 - (-10) >= 4)) || ((x >= 0) && (y >= 0) && (10 - 3 >= 4)));
