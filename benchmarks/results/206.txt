Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x > -100)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x < 200)
Addind predicate x < 200 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(z > 100)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(z < 200)
Addind predicate z < 200 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x < 200', 'z < 200']
Verifying formula: ( and ( < x 200 ) ( < z 200 ) )
For candidate: assert((x < 200) && (z < 200))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x < 200) && (z < 200))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x < 200) && (z < 200))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
