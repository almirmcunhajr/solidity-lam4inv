Predicate filtering verify set: ['(x + y) == k', '0 <= j', '0 <= m', 'm <= j', 'x + y == k']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( = ( + x y ) k ) ( <= 0 j ) ) ( <= 0 m ) ) ( <= m j ) ) ( = ( + x y ) k ) )
For candidate: assert(((x + y) == k) && (0 <= j) && (0 <= m) && (m <= j) && (x + y == k))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert(((x + y) == k) && (0 <= j) && (0 <= m) && (m <= j) && (x + y == k))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert(((x + y) == k) && (0 <= j) && (0 <= m) && (m <= j) && (x + y == k))
