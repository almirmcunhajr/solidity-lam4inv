Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 1)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 2 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x >= 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x >= 1);
Verifying candidate: assert(x % 2 == 1);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(x % 2 == 1);
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
