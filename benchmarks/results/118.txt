Predicate filtering verify set: ['size >= 1', 'i - sn == 1', '1 <= i', 'sn >= 0', 'sn <= size', 'i <= size + 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( >= size 1 ) ( = ( - i sn ) 1 ) ) ( <= 1 i ) ) ( >= sn 0 ) ) ( <= sn size ) ) ( <= i ( + size 1 ) ) )
For candidate: assert((size >= 1) && (i - sn == 1) && (1 <= i) && (sn >= 0) && (sn <= size) && (i <= size + 1))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((size >= 1) && (i - sn == 1) && (1 <= i) && (sn >= 0) && (sn <= size) && (i <= size + 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((size >= 1) && (i - sn == 1) && (1 <= i) && (sn >= 0) && (sn <= size) && (i <= size + 1))
