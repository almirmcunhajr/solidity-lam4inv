Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 1)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= y && y <= 1024);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= y && y <= 1024);
Verifying candidate: assert((y == 0 && x == 1) || (y > 0 && x == 0));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((y == 0 && x == 1) || (y > 0 && x == 0));
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 27.93630886077881 seconds
