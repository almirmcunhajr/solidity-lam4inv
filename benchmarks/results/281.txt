Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x < y)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y <= 20000001)
Addind predicate y <= 20000001 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['y <= 20000001']
Verifying formula: ( <= y 20000001 )
For candidate: assert((y <= 20000001))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 2 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= y + 99);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(x <= y + 99);
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
