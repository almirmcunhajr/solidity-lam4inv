Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= 0)
Addind predicate x >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y >= 0)
Addind predicate y >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= y)
Addind predicate x >= y to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x >= 0', 'y >= 0', 'x >= y']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( >= x 0 ) ( >= y 0 ) ) ( >= x y ) )
For candidate: assert((x >= 0) && (y >= 0) && (x >= y))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x >= 0) && (y >= 0) && (x >= y))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x >= 0) && (y >= 0) && (x >= y))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 3.588420867919922 seconds
