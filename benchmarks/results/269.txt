Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(sum == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n >= 0)
Addind predicate n >= 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n >= 0']
Verifying formula: ( >= n 0 )
For candidate: assert((n >= 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(n >= 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(n >= 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= i && i <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= i && i <= n);
Verifying candidate: assert(sum == i * (i - 1) / 2);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(sum == i * (i - 1) / 2);
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
