Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == y)
Addind predicate x == y to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= 0)
Addind predicate x >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x + y + z == 0)
Addind predicate x + y + z == 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x == y', 'x >= 0', 'x + y + z == 0']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( = x y ) ( >= x 0 ) ) ( = ( + ( + x y ) z ) 0 ) )
For candidate: assert((x == y) && (x >= 0) && (x + y + z == 0))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x == y) && (x >= 0) && (x + y + z == 0))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x == y) && (x >= 0) && (x + y + z == 0))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 2.142390012741089 seconds
