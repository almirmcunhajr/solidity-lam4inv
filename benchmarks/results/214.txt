Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(unowned == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(nonexclusive == 0)
Addind predicate nonexclusive == 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(exclusive == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(invalid >= 1)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['nonexclusive == 0']
Verifying formula: ( = nonexclusive 0 )
For candidate: assert((nonexclusive == 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
