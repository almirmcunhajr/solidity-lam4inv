Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n > 0)
Addind predicate n > 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n > 0']
Verifying formula: ( > n 0 )
For candidate: assert((n > 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(n > 0);

Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n > 0);
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c >= 0);
Addind predicate c >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c <= n);
Addind predicate c <= n to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n > 0', 'c >= 0', 'c <= n']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( > n 0 ) ( >= c 0 ) ) ( <= c n ) )
For candidate: assert((n > 0) && (c >= 0) && (c <= n))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((n > 0) && (c >= 0) && (c <= n))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((n > 0) && (c >= 0) && (c <= n))
3 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
