Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 2 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= c);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= c);
Verifying candidate: assert(c <= 4);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(c <= 4);
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 15.368868112564087 seconds
The total runtime was 16.975869178771973 seconds
