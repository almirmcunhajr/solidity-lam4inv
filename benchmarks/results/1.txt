Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= y);
Addind predicate x >= y to verify set

Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 1 + (y * (y + 1)) / 2);
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x >= y', 'x >= 1', 'y >= 0']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( >= x y ) ( >= x 1 ) ) ( >= y 0 ) )
For candidate: assert((x >= y) && (x >= 1) && (y >= 0))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x >= y) && (x >= 1) && (y >= 0))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-4o-mini model: assert((x >= y) && (x >= 1) && (y >= 0))
