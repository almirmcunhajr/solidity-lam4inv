Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 500000)
Addind predicate y == 500000 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['y == 500000']
Verifying formula: ( = y 500000 )
For candidate: assert((y == 500000))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert((x < 500000 && y == 500000) || (x >= 500000 && y == x));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((x < 500000 && y == 500000) || (x >= 500000 && y == x));
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
