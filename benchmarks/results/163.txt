Predicate filtering verify set: ['n > 0', '0 <= b', 'b <= n', '0 <= j', 'j <= b', '((flag != 1)) || ((j == b))']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( > n 0 ) ( <= 0 b ) ) ( <= b n ) ) ( <= 0 j ) ) ( <= j b ) ) ( or ( distinct flag 1 ) ( = j b ) ) )
For candidate: assert((n > 0) && (0 <= b) && (b <= n) && (0 <= j) && (j <= b) && (((flag != 1)) || ((j == b))))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((n > 0) && (0 <= b) && (b <= n) && (0 <= j) && (j <= b) && (((flag != 1)) || ((j == b))))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((n > 0) && (0 <= b) && (b <= n) && (0 <= j) && (j <= b) && (((flag != 1)) || ((j == b))))
