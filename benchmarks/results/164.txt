Predicate filtering verify set: ['n > 0', 'b <= n', '((flag == 1 && j == b)) || ((flag != 1 && j == 0))', 'j <= n']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( > n 0 ) ( <= b n ) ) ( or ( and ( = flag 1 ) ( = j b ) ) ( and ( distinct flag 1 ) ( = j 0 ) ) ) ) ( <= j n ) )
For candidate: assert((n > 0) && (b <= n) && (((flag == 1 && j == b)) || ((flag != 1 && j == 0))) && (j <= n))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((n > 0) && (b <= n) && (((flag == 1 && j == b)) || ((flag != 1 && j == 0))) && (j <= n))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((n > 0) && (b <= n) && (((flag == 1 && j == b)) || ((flag != 1 && j == 0))) && (j <= n))
