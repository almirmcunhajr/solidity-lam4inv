Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x == y) && (i <= j) && (i >= 0) && (j >= 0) && (i == x * (x + 1) / 2) && (j >= i))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-mini model: assert((x == y) && (i <= j) && (i >= 0) && (j >= 0) && (i == x * (x + 1) / 2) && (j >= i))
