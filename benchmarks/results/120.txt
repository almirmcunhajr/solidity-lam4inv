Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(sn == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 1)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 6 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(i == sn + 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i == sn + 1);
Verifying candidate: assert(sn == i - 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(sn == i - 1);
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= sn);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= sn);
Verifying candidate: assert(sn <= 8);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(sn <= 8);
Verifying candidate: assert(1 <= i);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(1 <= i);
Verifying candidate: assert(i <= 9);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i <= 9);
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == sn + 1);
Addind predicate i == sn + 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(sn == i - 1);
Addind predicate sn == i - 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(0 <= sn);
Addind predicate 0 <= sn to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(sn <= 8);
Addind predicate sn <= 8 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(1 <= i);
Addind predicate 1 <= i to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i <= 9);
Addind predicate i <= 9 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['i == sn + 1', 'sn == i - 1', '0 <= sn', 'sn <= 8', '1 <= i', 'i <= 9']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( = i ( + sn 1 ) ) ( = sn ( - i 1 ) ) ) ( <= 0 sn ) ) ( <= sn 8 ) ) ( <= 1 i ) ) ( <= i 9 ) )
For candidate: assert((i == sn + 1) && (sn == i - 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= 8) && (1 <= i) && (i <= 9))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((i == sn + 1) && (sn == i - 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= 8) && (1 <= i) && (i <= 9))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((i == sn + 1) && (sn == i - 1) && (0 <= sn) && (sn <= 8) && (1 <= i) && (i <= 9))
