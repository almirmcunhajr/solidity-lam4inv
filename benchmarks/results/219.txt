Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(s == 0)
Addind predicate s == 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['s == 0']
Verifying formula: ( = s 0 )
For candidate: assert((s == 0))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((s == 0))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((s == 0))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 0.9119901657104492 seconds
