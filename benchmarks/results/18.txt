Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 1)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m == 1)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-4o and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x >= 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x >= 1);
Verifying candidate: assert(m >= 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(m >= 1);
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x <= n);
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= 1);
Addind predicate x >= 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m >= 1);
Addind predicate m >= 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= n);
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x >= 1', 'm >= 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( >= x 1 ) ( >= m 1 ) )
For candidate: assert((x >= 1) && (m >= 1))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x >= 1) && (m >= 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-4o model: assert((x >= 1) && (m >= 1))
3 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
