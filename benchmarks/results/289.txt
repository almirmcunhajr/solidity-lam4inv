Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x < y)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y <= 20000001)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x < y);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x < y);
Verifying candidate: assert((x < 0 && y < 0 && y - x >= -16) || (x < 0 && y >= 0 && y - x >= -16) || (x >= 0 && y - x >= -16));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((x < 0 && y < 0 && y - x >= -16) || (x < 0 && y >= 0 && y - x >= -16) || (x >= 0 && y - x >= -16));
