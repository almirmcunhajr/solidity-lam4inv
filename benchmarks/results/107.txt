Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Addind predicate j == 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['j == 0']
Verifying formula: ( = j 0 )
For candidate: assert((j == 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(j == 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(j == 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(k <= 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(k <= 1);
Verifying candidate: assert((k == 0) || (m >= a));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((k == 0) || (m >= a));
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
