Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x > 0)
Addind predicate x > 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x > 0']
Verifying formula: ( > x 0 )
For candidate: assert((x > 0))

Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(0 <= i);
Addind predicate 0 <= i to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i <= x);
Addind predicate i <= x to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 2 * i);
Addind predicate j == 2 * i to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x > 0);
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x > 0', '0 <= i', 'i <= x', 'j == 2 * i']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( > x 0 ) ( <= 0 i ) ) ( <= i x ) ) ( = j ( * 2 i ) ) )
For candidate: assert((x > 0) && (0 <= i) && (i <= x) && (j == 2 * i))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x > 0) && (0 <= i) && (i <= x) && (j == 2 * i))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((x > 0) && (0 <= i) && (i <= x) && (j == 2 * i))
4 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
