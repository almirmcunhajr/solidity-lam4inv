Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n > 0)
Addind predicate n > 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n > 0']
Verifying formula: ( > n 0 )
For candidate: assert((n > 0))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 2 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(n > 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(n > 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= c && c <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= c && c <= n);
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n > 0);
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(0 <= c && c <= n);
Addind predicate 0 <= c to verify set
Addind predicate c <= n to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n > 0', '0 <= c', 'c <= n']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( > n 0 ) ( <= 0 c ) ) ( <= c n ) )
For candidate: assert((n > 0) && (0 <= c) && (c <= n))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((n > 0) && (0 <= c) && (c <= n))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((n > 0) && (0 <= c) && (c <= n))
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
