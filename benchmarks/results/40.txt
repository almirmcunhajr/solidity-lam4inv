Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(n > 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(n > 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(c >= 0);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(c >= 0);
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
