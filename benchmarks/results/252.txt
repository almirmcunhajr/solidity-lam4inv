Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(a == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(b == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 1)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(a == b);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(a == b);
Verifying candidate: assert(i % 2 == 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i % 2 == 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(j == i + 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(j == i + 1);
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(a == b);
Addind predicate a == b to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i % 2 == 0);
Addind predicate i % 2 == 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == i + 1);
Addind predicate j == i + 1 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['a == b', 'i % 2 == 0', 'j == i + 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( = a b ) ( = ( mod i 2 ) 0 ) ) ( = j ( + i 1 ) ) )
For candidate: assert((a == b) && (i % 2 == 0) && (j == i + 1))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((a == b) && (i % 2 == 0) && (j == i + 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((a == b) && (i % 2 == 0) && (j == i + 1))
3 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
