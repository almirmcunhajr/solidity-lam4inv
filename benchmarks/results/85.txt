Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x - y * (y - 1) / 2 < 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x - y * (y - 1) / 2 < 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(x - y * (y - 1) / 2 <= -15000);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x - y * (y - 1) / 2 <= -15000);
Verifying candidate: assert(!(x >= 0) || (y > 0));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(!(x >= 0) || (y > 0));
