Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= 0)
Addind predicate x >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= y)
Addind predicate x <= y to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y < n)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x >= 0', 'x <= y']
Verifying formula: ( and ( >= x 0 ) ( <= x y ) )
For candidate: assert((x >= 0) && (x <= y))

Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x >= 0) && (x <= y) && (y <= n) && (x <= n) && (y >= x))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((x >= 0) && (x <= y) && (y <= n) && (x <= n) && (y >= x))
