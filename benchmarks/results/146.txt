Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 1)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(0 <= y && y <= 1024);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(0 <= y && y <= 1024);
Verifying candidate: assert(x == 0 || y == 0);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(x == 0 || y == 0);
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 24.504952669143677 seconds
The total runtime was 25.67770791053772 seconds
