Predicate filtering verify set: ['exp == 1', 'result == 2', 'x > -1', 'x < 1', 'x == 0', 'count >= 1', '((term == 0)) || ((term == 1))', 'exp <= result']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( = exp 1 ) ( = result 2 ) ) ( > x ( - 0 1 ) ) ) ( < x 1 ) ) ( = x 0 ) ) ( >= count 1 ) ) ( or ( = term 0 ) ( = term 1 ) ) ) ( <= exp result ) )
For candidate: assert((exp == 1) && (result == 2) && (x > -1) && (x < 1) && (x == 0) && (count >= 1) && (((term == 0)) || ((term == 1))) && (exp <= result))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((exp == 1) && (result == 2) && (x > -1) && (x < 1) && (x == 0) && (count >= 1) && (((term == 0)) || ((term == 1))) && (exp <= result))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((exp == 1) && (result == 2) && (x > -1) && (x < 1) && (x == 0) && (count >= 1) && (((term == 0)) || ((term == 1))) && (exp <= result))
