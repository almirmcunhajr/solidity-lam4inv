Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 1)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 1 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x >= 1);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x >= 1);
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= 1);
Addind predicate x >= 1 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x >= 1']
Verifying formula: ( >= x 1 )
For candidate: assert((x >= 1))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-mini and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x >= 1);
Candidate already in fail history: assert(x >= 1);
Verifying candidate: assert((n <= 0) || (x <= n + 1));
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert((n <= 0) || (x <= n + 1));
Verifying candidate: assert((n <= 0) || (x == 1) || (y == n - (x - 1)));
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert((n <= 0) || (x == 1) || (y == n - (x - 1)));

Filtering predicates for candidate assert((n <= 0) || (x <= n + 1));
Addind predicate ((n <= 0)) || ((x <= n + 1)) to verify set

Predicate filtering verify set: ['x >= 1', '((n <= 0)) || ((x <= n + 1))', '((n <= 0)) || ((x == 1)) || ((y == n - (x - 1)))']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( >= x 1 ) ( or ( <= n 0 ) ( <= x ( + n 1 ) ) ) ) ( or ( or ( <= n 0 ) ( = x 1 ) ) ( = y ( - n ( - x 1 ) ) ) ) )
For candidate: assert((x >= 1) && (((n <= 0)) || ((x <= n + 1))) && (((n <= 0)) || ((x == 1)) || ((y == n - (x - 1)))))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x >= 1) && (((n <= 0)) || ((x <= n + 1))) && (((n <= 0)) || ((x == 1)) || ((y == n - (x - 1)))))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-mini model: assert((x >= 1) && (((n <= 0)) || ((x <= n + 1))) && (((n <= 0)) || ((x == 1)) || ((y == n - (x - 1)))))
