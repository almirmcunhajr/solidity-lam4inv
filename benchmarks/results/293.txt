Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(r > i + j)
Addind predicate r > i + j to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['r > i + j']
Verifying formula: ( > r ( + i j ) )
For candidate: assert((r > i + j))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((r > i + j))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((r > i + j))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
