Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(d1 == 1)
Addind predicate d1 == 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(d2 == 1)
Addind predicate d2 == 1 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(d2 == 1)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['d1 == 1', 'd2 == 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( = d1 1 ) ( = d2 1 ) )
For candidate: assert((d1 == 1) && (d2 == 1))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((d1 == 1) && (d2 == 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((d1 == 1) && (d2 == 1))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
