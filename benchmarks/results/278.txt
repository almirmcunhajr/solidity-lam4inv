Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k > i - j)
Addind predicate k > i - j to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i < j)
Predicate filtering verify set: ['k > i - j']
Verifying formula: ( > k ( - i j ) )
For candidate: assert((k > i - j))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((k > i - j))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((k > i - j))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
