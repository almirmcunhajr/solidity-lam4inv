Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == y)
Addind predicate x == y to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(lock == 1)
Addind predicate lock == 1 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x == y', 'lock == 1']
Verifying formula: ( and ( = x y ) ( = lock 1 ) )
For candidate: assert((x == y) && (lock == 1))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x == y) && (lock == 1))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x == y) && (lock == 1))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 2.341233968734741 seconds
