Predicate filtering verify set: ['d1 == 1', 'd2 == 1', 'd3 == 1', 'x2 >= x1', 'x3 >= x1', 'x1 >= 0', 'x2 >= 0', 'x3 >= 0']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( and ( = d1 1 ) ( = d2 1 ) ) ( = d3 1 ) ) ( >= x2 x1 ) ) ( >= x3 x1 ) ) ( >= x1 0 ) ) ( >= x2 0 ) ) ( >= x3 0 ) )
For candidate: assert((d1 == 1) && (d2 == 1) && (d3 == 1) && (x2 >= x1) && (x3 >= x1) && (x1 >= 0) && (x2 >= 0) && (x3 >= 0))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((d1 == 1) && (d2 == 1) && (d3 == 1) && (x2 >= x1) && (x3 >= x1) && (x1 >= 0) && (x2 >= 0) && (x3 >= 0))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((d1 == 1) && (d2 == 1) && (d3 == 1) && (x2 >= x1) && (x3 >= x1) && (x1 >= 0) && (x2 >= 0) && (x3 >= 0))
