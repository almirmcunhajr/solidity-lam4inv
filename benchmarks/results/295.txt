Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 2 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= 100000000);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x <= 100000000);
Verifying candidate: assert((x < 10000000) || (x % 2 == 0));
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert((x < 10000000) || (x % 2 == 0));
Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= 100000000);
Addind predicate x <= 100000000 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert((x < 10000000) || (x % 2 == 0));
Addind predicate ((x < 10000000)) || ((x % 2 == 0)) to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x <= 100000000', '((x < 10000000)) || ((x % 2 == 0))']
Verifying formula: ( and ( <= x 100000000 ) ( or ( < x 10000000 ) ( = ( mod x 2 ) 0 ) ) )
For candidate: assert((x <= 100000000) && (((x < 10000000)) || ((x % 2 == 0))))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x <= 100000000) && (((x < 10000000)) || ((x % 2 == 0))))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((x <= 100000000) && (((x < 10000000)) || ((x % 2 == 0))))
