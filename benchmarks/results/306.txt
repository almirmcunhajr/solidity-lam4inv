Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(l == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(n <= 20000001)
Addind predicate n <= 20000001 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n <= 20000001']
Verifying formula: ( <= n 20000001 )
For candidate: assert((n <= 20000001))
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(n <= 20000001);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(n <= 20000001);
Verifying candidate: assert(i == (l + 1) / 2);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i == (l + 1) / 2);
Verifying candidate: assert(j == l / 2);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(j == l / 2);
Verifying candidate: assert((i + j) == l);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert((i + j) == l);
