Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == n)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 3 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x <= n);
Verifying candidate: assert(n < 1 || (1 <= x && x <= n));
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(n < 1 || (1 <= x && x <= n));
1 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 33.55605411529541 seconds
The total runtime was 34.16393518447876 seconds
