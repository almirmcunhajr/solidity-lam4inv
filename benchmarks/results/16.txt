Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 4 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(m >= 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(m >= 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(x >= 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x >= 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(x <= n);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(x <= n);

Executing predicate filtering
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m >= 0);
Addind predicate m >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= 0);
Addind predicate x >= 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= n);
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(m <= x);
Addind predicate m <= x to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['m >= 0', 'x >= 0', 'm <= x']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( >= m 0 ) ( >= x 0 ) ) ( <= m x ) )
For candidate: assert((m >= 0) && (x >= 0) && (m <= x))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((m >= 0) && (x >= 0) && (m <= x))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((m >= 0) && (x >= 0) && (m <= x))
4 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 39.055641889572144 seconds
The total runtime was 41.16745615005493 seconds
