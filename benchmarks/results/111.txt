Addind predicate i - 1 <= n to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['n >= 1', 'i >= 1', 'sn >= 0', 'i - 1 == sn', 'i - 1 <= n']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( >= n 1 ) ( >= i 1 ) ) ( >= sn 0 ) ) ( = ( - i 1 ) sn ) ) ( <= ( - i 1 ) n ) )
For candidate: assert((n >= 1) && (i >= 1) && (sn >= 0) && (i - 1 == sn) && (i - 1 <= n))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((n >= 1) && (i >= 1) && (sn >= 0) && (i - 1 == sn) && (i - 1 <= n))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((n >= 1) && (i >= 1) && (sn >= 0) && (i - 1 == sn) && (i - 1 <= n))
