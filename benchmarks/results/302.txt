Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == 0)
Predicate filtering verify set: []
Generating loop invariants candidates with model gpt-5-nano and presence penalty 0.0
Generated 5 candidates
Verifying generated candidates
Verifying candidate: assert(i >= 0);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i >= 0);
Verifying candidate: assert(i <= 50000000);
Candidate failed verification
Adding candidate to fail history: assert(i <= 50000000);
Verifying candidate: assert(i == (i / 4) * 4);
# Result
Solution found by the gpt-5-nano model: assert(i == (i / 4) * 4);
2 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
