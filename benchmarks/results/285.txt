Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
Addind predicate x == 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 0)
Addind predicate y == 0 to verify set
Filtering predicates for candidate assert(z == 0)
Addind predicate z == 0 to verify set
Predicate filtering verify set: ['x == 0', 'y == 0', 'z == 0']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( = x 0 ) ( = y 0 ) ) ( = z 0 ) )
For candidate: assert((x == 0) && (y == 0) && (z == 0))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x == 0) && (y == 0) && (z == 0))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x == 0) && (y == 0) && (z == 0))
0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
The total runtime was 1.905574083328247 seconds
