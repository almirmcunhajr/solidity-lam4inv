Predicate filtering verify set: ['n >= 1', 'j >= 0', 'j <= n', 'k + j >= n', 'k >= 0']
Verifying formula: ( and ( and ( and ( and ( >= n 1 ) ( >= j 0 ) ) ( <= j n ) ) ( >= ( + k j ) n ) ) ( >= k 0 ) )
For candidate: assert((n >= 1) && (j >= 0) && (j <= n) && (k + j >= n) && (k >= 0))
Predicate filtering found solution: assert((n >= 1) && (j >= 0) && (j <= n) && (k + j >= n) && (k >= 0))
# Result
Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the gpt-5-nano model: assert((n >= 1) && (j >= 0) && (j <= n) && (k + j >= n) && (k >= 0))
